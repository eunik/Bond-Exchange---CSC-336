# Bond Exchange - CSC 336
This project was used actual data from each national bank. We used data to show how bond exchange can effect the prime interest rate, exchange rate, currency, currency supply, and coupon.  
However, the php focused mainly on the interest rate after some random bidding.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have a MySQL database, and run the SQL ingestion on your own local or remote database.

## How to Run
First run "populate_db.py" on MySQL to create a new database.  
Then run "interest_rate.py" to get the result.
